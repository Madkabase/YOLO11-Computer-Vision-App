# Images Directory

This directory contains sample images for the YOLO11 Computer Vision App.

Due to file size limitations, only a few sample images are included in this repository. You can add your own images to this directory to use with the application.

## Sample Images

- `image1.jpg`: Default sample image for object detection
- `detectedimage1.jpg`: Sample image with detected objects

## Usage

When you run the application, it will automatically load the default images if no custom image is uploaded.
