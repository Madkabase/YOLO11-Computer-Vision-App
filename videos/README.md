This directory contains sample videos for the YOLO11 Computer Vision App.

Due to file size limitations, the sample videos are not included in this repository. You need to add your own videos to this directory to use with the application.

## Expected Videos

The application is configured to look for the following video files:
- `video1.mp4`
- `video2.mp4`

## Usage

When you run the application and select "Video" as the source, you can choose from the available videos in this directory.
